My solutions for interesting Codewars problems 

1 - Pyramids slide down: for a succession of lists of increasing length (forming a pyramid if stacked), finds the path that gives the highest sum when sliding down the pyramid

2 - Short script extracting the domain name from a url (tldextract not allowed)

3 - A swift implementation of a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku grids
