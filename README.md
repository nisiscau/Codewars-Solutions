# Codewars-Solutions
My solutions for interesting Codewars problems 

1 - Pyramids slide down: for a succession of lists of increasing length (forming a pyramid if stacked), finds the path that gives the highest sum when sliding down the pyramid

2 - Short script extracting the domain name from a url (tldextract not allowed)

3 - A swift implementation of a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku grids

4 - Write a method that takes a field for well-known board game "Battleship" as an argument and returns true if it has a valid disposition of ships, false otherwise. Argument is guaranteed to be 10*10 two-dimension array. Elements in the array are numbers, 0 if the cell is free and 1 if occupied by ship.
